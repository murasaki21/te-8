      Technical Exercise 8:
      <br />
      Paper.js
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Overview:
    </h2>
    <p>
      For Technical Exercise 8, you will be tasked with creating your own
      version of one of the Paper.js examples and hosting it on a page similar
      to this.<br />
      <br />
      While Paper.js is most often used with Node.js, for this exercise we will
      be using the a simpler method by loading the file directly into our
      project.<br />
      <br />
      <strong
        >Due Sunday October 24th at Midnight on Canvas<br /><br />Submit links
        to your live site AND code.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <h3>
      File/Code Requirements
    </h3>
    <p>
      Your exercise will consist of an HTML page which connects to a
      style-sheet, the paper.js source script and your example script.:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The HTML page will need a canvas element to connect your script to your
        page. Read this page in full for details:
        <a
          href="http://paperjs.org/tutorials/getting-started/working-with-paper-js/"
          >Working With Paper.js</a
        >
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        The style sheet should dictate the size of the canvas and should be used
        to create a cohesive color scheme.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        The Paper.js source script an be downloaded here:
        <a href="http://paperjs.org/download/">Download Paper.js</a><br />(It
        can also be copied from this repo.)
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        The script itself should be based on one of the examples found here:
        <a href="http://paperjs.org/examples/">Paper.js Examples</a>. You should
        be modifying the example in a significant way by doing multiple of the
        following:<br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>Changing color and/or stroke weight</li>
          <li>Changing the source imagery</li>
          <li>
            Changing the method of interaction (mouse to keyboard or etc.)
          </li>
          <li>Changing the speed/motion</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Finally, you should list the changes you made and put a link to the
        original example and any source imagery used.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Partial Example
    </h3>
    <p>
      The following example shows how to place a script onto the page and how to
      use an alternative image. I would want to change 1 or 2 more things to
      complete the assignment but this is a start.
    </p>
    <br />
    <!-- Canvas for my Paper.js script -->
    <canvas id="myCanvas" crossorigin="anonymous" resize></canvas><br /><br />
    <p>
      I used this example as a starting point:
      <a href="http://paperjs.org/examples/division-raster/"
        >Division Raster Example</a
      ><br /><br />
      And I used Franz Stuck's
      <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-stuck/medusa-1892"
        ><i>Medusa</i></a
      >, 1892 as source imagery in place of the <i>Mona Lisa</i>.
    </p>

      Technical Notes:

    <ul>
      <li>REMINDER! Use your browser's console to troubleshoot issues!</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        If you are using one of the image examples you will need to change some
        of the code to get your image to work. Info can be found here:

      <li>
        You will want to understand the different functions you can use which is
        covered in the reference here:
